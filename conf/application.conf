# The application languages

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#

#scala-test
db.default.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
db.default.url="jdbc:postgresql:bilby_io"
db.default.user=play	
db.default.password="play"

#slick.default="components.ActiveSlickCake.cake.Players"

# Evolutions

# You can disable evolutions if needed

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=INFO

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=DEBUG

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

logger.scala.slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend.statement=INFO
